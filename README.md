## Documentation

- Register a new user and explore public groups. If the group is public, select 'join' and you'll be added as a member to that group. If the group is private, 
a request to join will be sent to the admin of that group. Once you are approved, you will be able to view the quotes from that group.
- Post relevant quotes to the groups you've joined. Provide some context for the quote for other users.
- Select 'create new group' to make your own QuoteWall group. Set it to private or public depending on your preference. Any group you create you will become the admin. 
- If you are the admin, you are able to delete quotes in your group, regardless of who posted it. A 'requests' tab will also be displayed for admins of users waiting for
approval to join.
